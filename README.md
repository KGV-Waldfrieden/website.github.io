# the README

## dev-stage

This project site is intended only as a development environment for a (german) "Kleingartenverein"-website - and here just a fork of that.

It started as a proof of concept on using static site generation for static websites and the possibilities to host them w/o costs.

As it fitted the requirements so far we use **it** (a Markdown based bunch of text-files, the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com)-based generation of the static website and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) as a hosting plattform) now in production.

## Website

The result is automatically deployed to <https://kgv-waldfrieden.github.io/website.github.io/>.

The official website of the according "Kleingartenverein": <https://www.kgv-waldfrieden-hannover.de>
